        <h3>Website for St Mary the Virgin Church</h3>

        <p>’ve been working on another website for a little while. This one is for St Mary the Virgin Church in
            Arbroath, they didn’t have one so asked me if I’d do one.</p>
        <p>I spoke with the Reverend of the church and the brief he gave was to have a site that was different to all
            the other sites nowadays. He didn’t want boring and conventional, he wanted fun and different, interesting,
            and interactive. It was settled upon to have a layout of boxes that represent links, and which animate on
            mouse-over. He also didn’t want a conventional banner and navigation bar. In the end I implemented a
            hamburger menu bar discreetly in the corner, this was because some pages went 2 layers deep with the
            possibility of further. I thought this necessitated a menu so users could find their way back home.</p>

        <p>The site went live earlier this week. I have mixed feelings about it as I like conventional layouts with all
            the standard elements. However, this is a bit wacky, which may have been one of the keywords in the brief.
