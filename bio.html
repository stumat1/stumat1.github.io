      <h3>Professional Background</h3>

      <p>
        I am a Computing & IT professional currently pursuing a BSc in Computing
        and IT with Networking, driven by a passion for technology and its
        transformative potential. My academic journey focuses on mastering the
        core principles of computing, networking, and IT systems to build a
        strong foundation for a career in this ever-evolving field.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my studies, I actively contribute to my community through
        professional volunteer work. I've had the rewarding opportunity to serve
        as a Technical Support Specialist, assisting individuals with digital
        challenges, and have worked on several website design and creation
        projects for local organizations. These experiences have not only honed
        my technical skills but also reinforced my commitment to using
        technology to make a positive impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I am still building my professional experience in computing, my
        dedication to learning and my practical contributions to real-world
        projects reflect my enthusiasm and determination. I aim to combine my
        growing technical expertise with my community-focused mindset to pursue
        impactful and meaningful work in the tech industry.
