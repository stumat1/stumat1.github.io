      <h3>Welcome to my personal and professional space</h3>

      <p>
        I am a mature student currently pursuing studies in Computing and IT
        with Networking, driven by a passion for technology and its
        transformative potential. My academic journey focuses on mastering the
        core principles of computing, networking, and IT systems to build a
        strong foundation for a career in this ever-evolving field.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my studies, I actively contribute to my community through
        voluntary work. Iâ€™ve had the rewarding opportunity to serve as an IT
        Helper, assisting individuals with technical challenges, and have worked
        on several website design and creation projects for local charities.
        These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also
        reinforced my commitment to using technology to make a positive impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I am still building my professional experience in computing, my
        dedication to learning and my practical contributions to real-world
        projects reflect my enthusiasm and determination. I aim to combine my
        growing technical expertise with my community-focused mindset to pursue
        impactful and meaningful work in the tech industry.
      </p>
