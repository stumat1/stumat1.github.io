      <h3>Web Development: Carnoustie and Monifieth Men's Shed</h3>

      <p>
        Late December 2024 I handed over the website I had finished for the
        Carnoustie and Monifieth Men's (and Women's) Shed. As of now (January
        2025) I'm still with them to train people there in how to run and
        administer a Wordpress website. Training on how to add/edit/delete
        users, create posts, edit current pages to update content. I created a
        staging site for folk to work on without any changes affecting the
        production site.
      </p>

      <p>
        The site was a lot of work with requirements changing over time. At an
        early stage I implemented a shopping facility on the site for product
        sales, however that was dropped in favour of using Facebook for sales.
        The website acts partly as a shop front for products but not as a
        shopping platform. I also created a members are which has a members
        forum where members can post and share anything digitally. I'm unsure
        how much it will get used but it's a facility that is there.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoyed (enjoy) creating this website, the folk at the Men's (and
        women's) shed are all lovely to work with. They gifted me a lovely
        desktop clock they hand-made (well, everything's hand-made) which was
        very nice of them.
