        <h3>Web Development: Carnoustie and Monifieth Men's Shed</h3>

        <p>Over the last couple of months I've been working with the Carnoustie and Monifieth Men's (and Women's) Shed in developing a website for their organisation. This is 
            the largest project I've undertaken. The initial plans were not in place so the volunteer co-ordinator I am connected with, and I, have undertaken to establish what the 
            organisation want for their new online presence. This involved a lot of research and collaboration, and extensive communications. Initial thoughts included having an online store 
            and I had initiated a store for this purpose on the development site. However, it was realised that it was more practical to sell products via theirs and other local Facebook pages. 
            I learnt alot about WooCommerce integration though! I've created a private members area for the board members to share ideas privately. 
            It has an integrated forum and social media functionality. It also has a help section for assisiting in how to use WordPress to create posts, and how to use their webmail</p>

        <p>I guided them through registering and purchasing their domain and webhosting. I'm also assisting migrating from an old site they had 
            which had died (the creator was AWOL). I'll be adding a redirect to the old domain which, fortunately, they still have access to. 
            I've setup email accounts for all Shed board members with appropriate forwarding, through cPanel.</p>
        <p>I am far into the development (September, 2024), in fact the plan is to launch the site at the groups AGM in October. 
            I'm having to push my WordPress skills hard and learn substantially more than on the previous builds.</p>

            <p>Update and links when site goes live.</p>
