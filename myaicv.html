      <h3>AI Generated Voluntary Work Summary</h3>

      <p>
        For my sins I am not the most confident writer. Embracing the latest
        tools is vital in technology. So, I fed my volunteering pages into an AI
        tool and it wrote a summary of my volunteering work, as outlined
        seperately in individual pages here, and below is the the product (after
        some modification). Written far better than I could write.

      <h3>Professional Volunteering and Skills Development Summary</h3>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        As a mature student pursuing a degree in Computing and IT with
        Networking, I have actively engaged in meaningful volunteer work that
        has significantly enhanced my technical skills, professional
        development, and community impact. Through diverse volunteering
        opportunities, I have gained practical experience in web development,
        digital literacy support, and technical training while making a tangible
        difference in my local community.
      </p>

      <h3>Web Development Experience</h3>

      <h4>Church of the Holy Rood Website Development</h4>
      <p>
        My first professional web development project involved creating a
        website for the Church of the Holy Rood. This foundational experience
        provided valuable learning opportunities as I navigated the challenges
        of working with real clients and delivering solutions that met their
        specific needs. The success of this project led to an opportunity to
        refresh and improve the website as my skills developed, demonstrating my
        commitment to continuous improvement and client satisfaction.
      </p>

      <h4>St Mary the Virgin Church - Innovative Web Design</h4>
      <p>
        Working with St Mary the Virgin Church in Arbroath presented unique
        challenges that pushed my creative and technical boundaries. The client
        specifically requested a departure from conventional website design,
        seeking something "fun, different, interesting, and interactive." I
        successfully delivered an innovative solution featuring animated box
        layouts with mouse-over effects and a discreet hamburger menu system.
        This project demonstrated my ability to balance client vision with
        practical usability considerations while expanding my design
        capabilities.
      </p>

      <h4>Carnoustie and Monifieth Men's Shed - Comprehensive Web Solution</h4>
      <p>
        This project represented my most complex undertaking to date, involving
        the development of a full-featured website with evolving requirements. I
        successfully implemented and later adapted features including an initial
        e-commerce solution (subsequently modified for Facebook integration), a
        members' area with integrated forum functionality, and comprehensive
        content management capabilities. Beyond development, I created training
        materials and a staging environment to empower the organization's
        members to maintain their website independently. This project showcased
        my ability to manage complex requirements, adapt to changing needs, and
        provide ongoing support and training.
      </p>

      <h3>Digital Literacy and Community Support</h3>

      <h4>Adult Literacy & Learning Volunteer</h4>

        - Providing personalized technical support for mobile devices, tablets,
        and laptops
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience highlighted the critical importance of digital inclusion
        in our increasingly connected society and allowed me to develop strong
        communication and teaching skills while making a meaningful impact on
        digital disenfranchisement in my community.
      </p>

      <h4>Learning Shop, Arbroath - Ongoing Support</h4>

        are essential for a successful career in technology. This experience has
        reinforced my commitment to using technology as a tool for positive
        social impact while building the practical skills and confidence needed
        for professional success.
      </p>

        professional development through volunteering has provided an invaluable
        foundation for my career in computing and IT, demonstrating my ability

        my community.
