      <h3>Volunteer Helper: Learning Shop, Arbroath</h3>

      <p>
       The person from the council who I was working with at the wellbeing café has asked me to help out at the Learning Shop in Arbroath.
        I’ve been there for a few weeks now and I’m really enjoying it. I’m helping adults with new and complex literacy skills needed for everyday life. 
        It’s a bit different to what I was doing at the café but I’m finding it really rewarding. 
        I’m helping people with things like learning to use mobile phones or personal tablets and laptops, getting help to 
        make on-line accounts to deal with things such energy bills, rent or shopping, and learning to 
        manage Universal Credit accounts.</p>
      <p>The following is their online information outline:</p>
<p style="color: green">Arbroath Learning Shop offers adults support with new and complex literacy skills needed for everyday life:</p>
<ul style="color: green">
  <li>Learning to use mobile phones or personal tablets and laptops</li>
  <li>Getting help to make on-line accounts to deal with things such as school meals, energy bills, rent or shopping</li>
  <li>Learning to manage Universal Credit accounts and communicate through journals</li>
  <li>Getting support with video messaging to stay in touch with family and friends or to use services such as on-line hospital appointments</li>
  <li>Learning how to manage dyslexia and get support using dyslexia tools at home or at work</li>
  <li>
  Improving reading, writing or numeracy skills and become more confident with handling information</li>
  <li>Getting first qualifications, preparing for college, the driving theory test, employment, entrance tests or training courses at work</li>
</ul>
      <p>It continues to provide really good experience in developing my communication skills and I get immediate feedback when I help people discover how to do 'this' or how to fix 'that'. I find it educationally and personally satisfying.</p>
