      <h2>Other Websites</h2>
      <p>
        As well as having created the websites outlined in my volunteering work
        section, I have created other websites over time, here are ones that I
        currently have online.
      </p>

      <h3>Christmas Countdown</h3>
      <a href="https://myadventcalendar.me/" target="_blank"
        ><img
          src="images/christmascountdown400.png"
          alt="Christmas Countdown"
          style="
            border: 2px solid #333;
            border-radius: 6px;
            max-width: 100%;
            height: auto;
          "
      /></a>

      <p>
        I created this website after thinking it would be a fun thing to do as
        we were approaching Christmas 2024. It started off simply with a
        different image for each day starting 25 days before. By the end it also
        had Christmas quotations. Now it has a placeholder image and messages
        that change during the year through to December 2025. The domain expires
        in December but I'll probably renew it to keep it alive.

      <h3>Ballet Story Online</h3>
      <a href="https://balletstory.online/" target="_blank"
        ><img
          src="images/balletstory400.png"
          alt="Ballet Story Online"
          style="
            border: 2px solid #333;
            border-radius: 6px;
            max-width: 100%;
            height: auto;
          "
      /></a>

      <p>
        I went to the ballet with a friend for the first time recently and
        really enjoyed it. At the time I was trying to think of another website
        to create, so I thought I'd make one on ballet storylines. Unlike the
        other websites, this one was generated completely by AI (Anthropic's
        Claude). All the design, layout, storylines, all the images, everything
        is AI. Well, everything except the little wavy logo image, I made that
        myself. Quite impressive what AI can do, I wonder what sites' designs it
        was copying when it spat this code out at me.
