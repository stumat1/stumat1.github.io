      <h2>Other Websites</h2>
      <p>
        As well as having created the websites outlined in my volunteering work
        section, I have created other websites over time, here are ones that I
        currently have online.
      </p>

      <h3>Christmas Countdown</h3>
      <a href="https://myadventcalendar.me/" target="_blank"
        ><img
          src="images/christmascountdown400.png"
          alt="Christmas Countdown"
          style="
            border: 2px solid #333;
            border-radius: 6px;
            max-width: 100%;
            height: auto;
          "
      /></a>

      <p>
        I created this website after thinking it would be a fun thing to do as
        we were approaching Christmas 2024. It started off simply with a
        different image for each day starting 25 days before. By the end it also
        had Christmas quotations. Now it has a placeholder image and messages
        that change during the year through to December 2025. The domain expires
        in December but I'll probably renew it to keep it alive.
