      <h3>Web Development: The Church of the Holy Rood</h3>

      <p>
        This was the first website that I did for someone else in 'professional'
        capacity (except for many, many, years ago). As such, I was rusty and on
        a learning curve throughout the build. The folk at the church were very
        happy with the website that I handed over to them, but I never really
        was.
      </p>
      <p>
        The volunteer co-ordinator I am in contact with is a church member also.
        It is through her links in the areas churches that she put me onto the
        St Mary the Virgin website project. As my skill/knowledge/confidence
        levels increased through implementing the St Mary church (and another
        church website which fell through), I expressed to her a desire to give
        the Holy Rood site a refresh, which fortunately she happily agreed to. I
        think it is much sharper and more pulled-together now. And she is happy
        with the refresh which is the important thing.
      </p>

        I’m quite chuffed with it. As it’s my first voluntarily born, I may
        hanker to come back to it in another 6 months to refresh it again, but
        don’t tell them!
