        <h3>Website for the church of the Holy Rood</h3>

        <p>This was the first website that I did for someone else in 'professional' capacity (except for many, many,
            years
            ago). As such, I was rusty and on a learning curve throughout the build. The folk at the church were very
            happy
            with the website that I handed over to them, but I never really was.</p>
        <p>The volunteer co-ordinator I am in contact with is a church member also. It is through her links in the areas
            churches that she put me onto the St Mary the Virgin website project. As my skill/knowledge/confidence
            levels
            increased through implementing the St Mary church (and another church website which fell through), I
            expressed
            to her a desire to give the Holy Rood site a refresh, which fortunately she was happily agreed to. I think
            it is
            now much sharper and pulled-together now. And she is happy with the refresh.
        <p>I’m quite chuffed with it. As it’s my first voluntarily born, I may hanker to come back to it in another 6
            months to refresh
            it again, but don’t tell them.</p>

        <p>Below is a recording of a walk-through of the refreshed website.</p>
