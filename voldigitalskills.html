        <h3>Volunteer Helper – Adult Literacy & Learning</h3>

        <p>I’ve been volunteering at a local community hub’s wellbeing café, which is run by the local Council, for about 9
        months now (June 2024). As a pre-check I submitted a disclosure check and have full clearance and certification to work with people
        in the community.</p>
        
        <p>My title is ‘Volunteer Helper – Adult Literacy & Learning’. I’m there to help people with their device whether
        it be mobile, tablet, or laptop. From helping them get setup online with banking, getting connected to the local
        council, through to showing how to send a text or WhatsApp message. It’s essentially a lot of the key basic IT
        literacy skills, enabling and instructing people in how to use their devices, and enabling access to a range
        internet services.</p>
        <p>It’s been educational as well as fun and I’ve met some interesting characters. My services seem to be
        appreciated, which is assuring.</p>
