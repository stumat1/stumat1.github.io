        <h3>Volunteer Helper: Adult Literacy & Learning</h3>

        <p>I’ve been volunteering at a local community hubs wellbeing café, which is run in conjunction with the local
            Council, for about 9
            months now (June 2024). As a pre-check I submitted a disclosure check and have full clearance and
            certification to work with people
            in the community. I am safe!</p>

        <p>My title is ‘Volunteer Helper – Adult Literacy & Learning’. I’m there to help people with their devices
            whether
            it be mobile, tablet, or laptop. From helping them get setup online with banking, getting connected to the
            local
            council to access services, through to showing how to send a text or WhatsApp message. It’s essentially a
            lot of the key basic IT
            literacy skills, instructing people in how to use their devices, and enabling access to a range
            internet-based services. With the transfer of so many services that used to be taken for granted on every
            high street moving to online only, I feel this is an extremely necessary role. The digital
            disenfranchisement is very real and a serious issue, depriving many of those that often need those services the most.</p>
        <p>It’s been educational as well as fun and I’ve met some interesting characters. My services seem to be
            appreciated, which is assuring.</p>

            <p><b>Update</b>: September 2024: The cafe has been in a period of stasis for some time. In its hayday it served a broad section of the community and 
                varied local charitable organisations were involved too. Sadly 3rd parties are no longer as particapatory
                as they once were, financial pressures being what they are. To get to the point, we've decided upon review of the cafe that my participation is 
                no longer required. It's the same people every week and month, and my serivces are not being utilised.
            It's been a fun and enlightening experience though, I've learnt a lot, and I've met some lovely people!</p>
