      <h2>Computing and IT Project</h2>

        
        <h3>The problem is:</h3>
        <p>
        Analysing network traffic data can be a complex task, especially for those who have no prior skills in networking technologies. There exist tools for this purpose such as Wireshark, but they are aimed at professional skilled networking experts.
        </p>
        <p>
        There exists a lack of user-friendly tools and interfaces for visualising network traffic. This means there is a gap in understanding network performance and security for both technical and non-technical users.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The stakeholders (who will benefit from the project):</h3>
        <p>Network administrators, educational institutes, small businesses, cybersecurity professionals.</p>
        
        <h3>The user(s) (who will use the project) is/are:</h3>
        <p>Students and teachers in networking and cybersecurity education, IT professionals, individual users.</p>
        
        <h3>The scope of the problem is:</h3>
        <p>
        This project aims to address the lack of accessible tools for visualizing network data. By capturing data, processing it, and then representing it visually, this project should:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simplify network data analysis</li>
          <li>Enable data visualisation</li>
          <li>Provide a cross-platform web-based tool that can be accessed from any device</li>
          <li>Serve student, teacher, and professional networking needs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Research already done into problem, any existing software in the area:</h3>
        <p>
        Many users are locked out of reach of existing tools due to cost, learning curve, and availability.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is a lack tools that are readily accessible through a web-based interface.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is a lack of easy to use tools that simplify traffic analysis for users.
        </p>
        <p>
        Wireshark: A well known tool for capturing and analysing network packets which has a learning curve and lacks visualisation.
        </p>
        <p>
        Splunk: This offers data analysis and visualisation but is aimed at enterprise and therefore inaccessible.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why I chose this project:</h3>
        <p>
        I chose this project because it re-inforces and extends both my networking and web development skills.
        </p>
        <p>
        This project addresses a real-world need for easily accessible web-based and simple to use tools.
        </p>
        <p>
        This project would be useful for other learners and educational institutions as well as current networking professionals.
        </p>
        
        <h3>I have/will be able to find out more by talking to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Network administrators to identify and develop network analysis requirements</li>
          <li>Teachers to learn how this project may assist in networking courses</li>
          <li>Other students to provide feedback on the tools and user interface effectiveness</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The skills I have from my L3 study include these which are relevant to the problem:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>TM357: CCNA level networking skill</li>
          <li>TM352: Web technologies tools and the development of web-based solutions - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, API's</li>
          <li>Problem solving</li>
          <li>Project management</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The ways in which I will be moving my skills and knowledge beyond the L3 module(s) are:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Development of networking knowledge and applying it to a real world scenario</li>
          <li>Data visualisation through using tools such as chart.js</li>
          <li>Frontend development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React</li>
          <li>Backend development using API's and database tools</li>
          <li>User interface design with usability as a key goal</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Any legal or ethical ramifications that might occur:</h3>
        <p>
        This project will require retrieving data from users' devices, processing it, and storage on a database. Therefore security is a primary concern as is adhering to data privacy requirements.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Will the project need approval regarding ethics:</h3>
        <p>
        There may need to be approval or verification of data privacy rules adherence.
        </p>
        <p>
        There will be a privacy/data policy page on the website that users can access. Users may be required to consent to having their data stored.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The end product I will deliver will be:</h3>
        <p>
        A functional, accessible, and easy to use web interface for users to visualise network data.
        </p>
        <p>Real time graphical representations.</p>
