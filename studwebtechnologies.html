        <li>Discuss issues of web design including accessibility, usability, localisation and globalisation</li>
        <li>Explain the role of the open source movement in the development of applications including collaborative
            development, licensing and reuse of resources</li>
        <li>Explain a range of security issues including secure protocols, use of certificates, authentication,
            authorisation, and firewalls</li>

            application</li>
        <li>Evaluate the suitability of a range of design tools and techniques for the development of an application
        </li>
    </ul>
